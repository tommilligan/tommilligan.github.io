    "title": "Little Alchemy - Network Map",
    "brief": "<p><a href='https://littlealchemy.com/' target='_blank'>Little Alchemy</a> is a game where you <i>'combine and discover new elements'</i>.A new element is created by adding two elements together. Drawing a network map can easily show how to make an astronaut, or what you call a human with a tool.</p>",
    "expandable": "<p>To visualise the network, elements and their parents were documented in XML, along with a precalculated colour (using my <a href='#WhatColorIsX'>WhatColorIsX</a> python module).From any set of starting elements, <i>n</i> generations of children are added to the network and an svg representation drawn using the javascript <a href='http://felix-kling.de/JSNetworkX/' target='_blank'>jsNetworkX</a> library.</p><p>This was a good project for building JQuery and ajax/XML knowledge - I aimed to host this on <a href='https://pages.github.com/' target='_blank'>Github Pages</a>, which doesn't allow server side scripting.As one of the first truly interactive websites I have built, I learnt more about javascript's asynchronous style and control flow.</p>",
